# react-native yelp_app
Thought it was about time for me to learn react-native

Locate `yelp.js` to replace your Yelp apikey

Things I've learned building this app:

- How to manage state between components with `useState`
- How to send props up and down through components
- `useEffect` hook and how it can be helpful to just execute a function once
- Axios library to make easier api requests
- How to setup and run expo
- Primative components
- Yelp's api
- Navigation and `withNavigation`
- How to structure a typical react-native component
